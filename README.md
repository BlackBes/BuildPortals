# BuildPortals
Bukkit/Spigot server plugin to allow players to build their own inter-world portals

Status:

This project at a pre-release. It is being beta-tested on a small server before posting to the greater community. I'll probably add Vehicle teleportation before actually distributing the plugin.

Use:

Once installed, any player can build a portal using a designated portal building material (Emerald Blocks by default) in a nether-portal-like rectangle, with at least large enough interior for a player to walk through and place an 'activator block' (any of Redstone blocks, Gold blocks or Diamond blocks by default) on each bottom block along the interior of the portal. They then build another portal where they would like to connect, placing matching 'activator block's in this portal. Once two complete and like-activated portals are built, the plugin converts the portal interior (including activator blocks) to air and links the portals! Each portal can be built by any player, in any world. Portals activated with each material can be started independantly with no conflict issues.

Planned updates:
 * Support for 'vehicle' class objects (horses, minecarts, etc.) to be teleported with a player.

If someone happens across this project, feel free to critique. I welcome tips/criticism/suggestions!
